# amazon-customer-review-data-daily-updated.-Python
In this project, we analyzed Amazon shopping reviews to uncover insights into customer sentiments, review patterns, and engagement metrics. Hereâ€™s a summary of what was accomplished:

## Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Handled missing values and data inconsistencies to ensure robust analysis.
Renamed columns for clarity and standardized data formats.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**

### Score Distribution:
Visualized the distribution of review scores to understand the prevalence of different ratings.
### Sentiment Analysis:
Analyzed sentiment trends and distribution, revealing patterns in customer satisfaction.
### Correlation and Trends:

### Review Length vs. Rating:
Investigated the relationship between the length of reviews and their ratings.
### Thumbs Up Count:
Analyzed the correlation between thumbs-up counts and review scores.
### Sentiment vs. Thumbs Up: 
Explored how sentiment scores relate to thumbs-up counts, providing insights into customer feedback.
### Keyword Analysis:
Identified and visualized the most common keywords in positive and negative reviews, offering insights into frequent themes and issues.

## Key Findings:
### Review Score Distribution:
The distribution of review scores indicates that negative reviews are more prevalent than positive reviews. This suggests that customers have more dissatisfaction than satisfaction, which could be an area of concern for the company.
### Sentiment Trends:
Due to the daily update frequency of the data, a comprehensive trend analysis over time was not conducted. Instead, the focus was on the overall sentiment distribution and patterns.
### Review Content Analysis:
-Most Common Keywords in ReviewsThe analysis reveals that users frequently discuss their overall experience with Amazon, app performance, ordering process, account management, customer service, and their needs for improvements.
### Review Length Impact:
Longer reviews tend to have lower ratings, which might reflect a more balanced view where detailed feedback includes both positive and negative aspects. Customers who write longer reviews often highlight both strengths and weaknesses, leading to an overall lower rating.
Thumbs-up counts are positively correlated with higher ratings, suggesting that reviews which receive more thumbs-up are generally rated higher. This indicates that reviews which resonate well with other users are often perceived as more positive and valuable.
## Future Work:
### Incorporate Product Information: 
Including product-specific data could provide deeper insights into review patterns and sentiments.
### Extended Sentiment Analysis: 
Using advanced sentiment analysis techniques or sentiment lexicons might yield more nuanced results.
### Trend Analysis: 
Investigating seasonal or event-driven trends could reveal additional patterns in customer feedback.
## Acknowledgments:
**Data Source:**  Kaggle
### Libraries and Tools: 
The analysis was conducted using Python, with key libraries including Pandas for data manipulation and cleaning, NumPy for numerical operations, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization. Jupyter Notebook was used as the development environment, and the project was executed on Kaggle Kernels for ease of sharing and collaboration.

Thank you for reviewing this analysis. I hope you found it insightful!
